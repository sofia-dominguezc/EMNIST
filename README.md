Diffusion model implementation in pytorch.

I built this as a personal project to practice using pytorch-lightning and training variational autoencoders (VAEs) and flow/diffusion models.

TODO:
- update README part 1 (after this i can show it to people)
- train models
- make a demo that looks nice
- update README
